**<u>Motivation.</u>**

The group project is designed to consolidate students’ understanding and
practical expertise in computer vision. Students will gain extensive
experience analyzing digital image data through state-of-the-art vision
models and advanced pattern recognition approaches. The collaborative
nature of the project cultivates leadership abilities, effective
teamwork, and professional communication skills through the delivery of
high-quality technical outputs. By bridging theoretical foundations with
real-world applications, this project equips students with both the
technical capabilities and professional competencies essential for
success in computer vision and AI development. Thus, it aligns with the
Intended Learning Outcomes (specifically, b, c, d, e) of COMP5523.

**<u>Task Specification.</u>**

In this project, let us develop a vision-based assistive system to help
visually impaired individuals navigate and interact with their
environment using advanced computer vision and deep learning models.
This system will assist users by providing real-time audio descriptions
of their surroundings, detecting obstacles, reading text, and
identifying objects through a camera interface.

The system could consist of various tasks, such as real-time object
detection, scene understanding, text recognition (OCR), depth
estimation, and so on. For example, a user could ask "What is in front
of me?" or "Read this text," and the system would analyze the camera
feed to provide accurate audio descriptions. The focus will be on
developing practical and reliable assistance for daily activities of
visually impaired individuals.

To successfully complete the project, each group will go through the
following key steps, using the knowledge and techniques learned in class
and beyond:

 **Data** **preparation:** Collect and organize relevant datasets for
testing (or training) visual models, including images of common objects,
scenes, text samples, and navigation scenarios. Preprocess the data to
ensure consistency and quality.

 **Algorithm** **design:** Explore state-of-the-art computer vision
approaches including object detection, semantic segmentation, scene
understanding, and so on. Implement efficient real-time processing
pipelines and design effective audio feedback generation strategies.
Integrate multiple vision models to provide comprehensive environmental
understanding.

 **System** **implementation:** Develop the assistive system using
frameworks such as PyTorch, OpenCV, and modern vision transformers.
Create a user-friendly interface that processes camera input and
provides clear and helpful audio feedback.

 **Performance** **evaluation:** Assess the system's accuracy,
reliability, and usefulness for visually impaired users. Measure
response times, detection accuracy, the clarity of audio descriptions,
and so on.

**<u>Important Dates.</u>**

There are two important demonstrations that students need to prepare:

> 1\. **In-Class** **Presentation** **with** **a** **Live**
> **Demonstration** **(18:30** **to** **21:20** **November** **25,**
> **2025)**: Each group will give a 15-minute presentation during the
> November 18, 2025 class. The presentation should showcase the task
> settings, challenges, methodologies, and their developed visual
> assistance system's functionality, features, and effectiveness. During
> the presentation, students will conduct a live demonstration,
> showcasing the system's capability to assist in real-world scenarios.
>
> **2.** **Project** **Report** **Submission** **(by** **23:59** **on**
> **December** **02,** **2025,** **Tuesday)**: Alongside the class
> presentation, each group should submit a comprehensive project report.
> The report should document the task setting, background, system
> development process, challenges, methodologies, outcomes, and
> evaluation results. Additionally, the group members' roles and
> contributions made by each group member (a maximum of 6 group members)
> should be delineated. The report should be **capped** **at** **8**
> **A4** **portrait** pages with unlimited spaces for references in APA
> formatting. There is no need to include a Table of Contents and the
> cover page. The text should be *formatted* *in* *12-size* *Times*
> *New* *Roman,* *1.0* *line* *space,* *and* *a* *single* *column*
> *with* *a* *1-inch* *margin,* while there are no requirements for
> figures and tables (students are encouraged to put in figures and
> tables to make the writing more eye-catching and easy to understand).

**<u>Assessment Rubrics.</u>**
